# Krita MCP Server — AI Diffusion Bridge Fork

> Fork of [nanayax3/krita-mcp](https://github.com/nanayax3/krita-mcp) that adds a live
> bridge to [Acly/krita-ai-diffusion](https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion).
> An MCP client can now drive AI image generation end-to-end from inside Krita:
> set prompts, switch styles, create regions, draw silhouette masks, generate,
> review results, and apply them — all without touching Krita's UI.

This bridge allows Claude (or any MCP client) to create canvases, paint strokes,
draw shapes, export images, **and now drive Krita AI Diffusion's full generation
pipeline** — all inside a running Krita instance.

## What This Fork Adds

The upstream `nanayax3/krita-mcp` exposes Krita's painting primitives (canvas,
brush, stroke, fill, shape, export). This fork keeps every existing tool intact
and adds a second surface that bridges to the AI Diffusion plugin running in the
same Krita process. The plugin imports `ai_diffusion.model.root` directly and
calls its API on Krita's main thread.

**Why this works without patching AI Diffusion:** the `kritamcp` plugin and the
`ai_diffusion` plugin both run inside Krita's embedded Python interpreter. Once
both are loaded, `kritamcp` can `from ai_diffusion.model.root import root` and
manipulate the live `Model` object that AI Diffusion uses internally. No fork
of the AI Diffusion plugin is needed.

13 new MCP tools are exposed (`krita_ai_*`). The original painting tools
are unchanged.

## How It Works

Two components:

1. **Krita Plugin** (`krita-plugin/`) — A Python plugin that runs inside Krita,
   exposing an HTTP server on `localhost:5678`. It receives commands and executes
   them on Krita's main thread via a command queue. New handlers (`cmd_ai_*`)
   bridge to the AI Diffusion plugin's internal API.

2. **MCP Server** (`server.py`) — A [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)
   server that exposes tools to any MCP client. Translates MCP tool calls into
   HTTP requests to the Krita plugin.

```
MCP Client (Claude, etc.)  ←→  MCP Server (server.py)  ←→  Krita Plugin (HTTP :5678)
                                                              │
                                                              ↓ (in-process import)
                                                          AI Diffusion plugin
                                                              │
                                                              ↓
                                                          ComfyUI backend
```

## Setup

### 1. Install Krita AI Diffusion (required for the AI tools)

Follow the install guide at https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion. The
plugin must be installed and the ComfyUI backend reachable. Without it, the
`krita_ai_*` tools will return an error but the painting tools still work.

### 2. Install the Krita MCP Plugin

Copy the plugin files to your Krita plugins directory:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\krita\pykrita\` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/krita/pykrita/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/krita/pykrita/` |

Copy both:
- `krita-plugin/kritamcp/` (the folder with `__init__.py`)
- `krita-plugin/kritamcp.desktop`

Then in Krita: **Settings → Configure Krita → Python Plugin Manager → Enable
"Krita MCP Bridge"** and restart Krita.

### 3. Install the MCP Server

```bash
pip install fastmcp httpx
```

Or with a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Your MCP Client

Add to your MCP client config (e.g., Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "krita": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

If using a virtual environment, point `command` at the venv's Python.

## Region Workflow Example

The canonical loop for region-based generation:

```text
1. krita_new_canvas(1024, 1024, "#ffffff")
2. krita_ai_set_params(style="cinematic-photo-xl")
3. krita_ai_set_prompt(positive="snowy mountain landscape, golden hour")
4. krita_ai_create_region(positive="grizzly bear standing on snow")
   → activates a fresh transparent paint layer
5. krita_set_color("#6b4226")
6. krita_draw_shape(shape="ellipse", x=70, y=520, width=420, height=320)
   ... draw rest of bear silhouette on the region's layer
7. krita_ai_create_region(positive="timber wolf, alert, side profile")
   → activates a second fresh layer
8. ... draw wolf silhouette
9. krita_ai_select_region()      # deselect → root active
10. krita_ai_generate()
11. krita_ai_list_jobs()         # wait until state == "finished"
12. krita_ai_save_preview(job_id="...") + Read the PNG to review
13. krita_ai_apply(job_id="...")
```

### Tips Learned the Hard Way

- **`create_region` forces a NEW empty paint layer** in this fork. Upstream
  AI Diffusion's `create_region` heuristic links the active layer if it happens
  to be a paint layer — which means linking the fully opaque canvas layer and
  making the region cover everything. The bridge bypasses that and always
  creates a fresh transparent layer for the silhouette mask.

- **Region size matters.** The doc says "ensure adequate size." In practice
  small silhouettes (under ~15% of the canvas) get ignored by the model. Aim
  for clearly distinct, sizable zones.

- **Two regions is reliable, three+ is fragile.** SDXL with two well-separated
  regions hit 2/2 consistently in testing. Three regions dropped to 1–2/3 hits.
  Per the AI Diffusion handbook, regions "are NOT a tool for composition" — they
  constrain prompts to areas but don't force subjects to appear. For strict
  multi-subject composition you need Control Layers (scribble / line-art /
  depth), which this bridge does not currently expose.

- **Root prompt is appended to every region prompt.** Keep root short and
  scene-level (style, mood, lighting) rather than describing the background in
  full. Strong scene description in root competes with region prompts and can
  make Flux-class models ignore the regions.

- **Model choice matters more than expected.** In multi-region tests,
  SDXL-class models (Juggernaut, Cinematic Photo XL, ZavyChroma) gave the
  most reliable per-region adherence. Turbo / 1-step models (Z-Image Turbo)
  effectively skip regional conditioning. Flux variants are too prompt-literal
  with a strong root prompt and tend to render only the global scene.

- **Img2img refine via strength < 1.0.** When `strength` is below 1.0 the
  workflow switches to refine — the existing canvas is used as the img2img
  source. Useful for style-transferring an existing image (set
  `style="digital-artwork-xl"`, `strength=0.6`, set a new prompt, generate).

## The Export Timeout Fix (from upstream)

By default HTTP requests and command queue operations time out after ~30 seconds.
Canvas export (`get_canvas`) and file save (`save`) operations can easily exceed
this on larger canvases. Both sides — MCP server timeout and plugin command queue
timeout — are bumped to 120s.

If you build new commands that can take a long time, remember to pass an
extended `timeout` to `send_command(...)` on both sides.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | How to Change |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Plugin HTTP port | `5678` | Edit `SERVER_PORT` in plugin `__init__.py` |
| MCP server URL | `http://localhost:5678` | Set `KRITA_URL` env var |
| Canvas output dir | `~/krita-mcp-output` | Edit `CANVAS_OUTPUT_DIR` in plugin `__init__.py` |
| Shared auth token | _(none)_ | Set `KRITAMCP_TOKEN` to the **same** value for both the plugin (env at Krita launch) and the MCP server |

### Security model

The plugin's HTTP server binds to `localhost` only, so remote machines can't
reach it. Two further guards protect against a malicious local web page driving
Krita (the classic CSRF / DNS-rebinding vector against a localhost server):

- **Origin guard (always on):** any request carrying an `Origin` or `Referer`
  header is rejected with `403`. A real MCP client speaks plain HTTP and sends
  neither; a browser always sends one.
- **Shared token (optional):** set `KRITAMCP_TOKEN` to require an
  `X-Kritamcp-Token` header on every request. Set the same value in the
  environment Krita launches from and for the MCP server process.

File paths passed to `krita_save` / `krita_open_file` are **not** sandboxed —
your MCP client is trusted to choose them, the same as any agent with disk
access.

Generated previews from `krita_ai_save_preview` and exports from
`krita_get_canvas` land in `CANVAS_OUTPUT_DIR`.

## Architecture Notes

### Why the bridge is a separate plugin

It would be cleaner to add MCP support directly into `ai_diffusion` as a
contributed feature. We chose a separate plugin so that:

- Upstream `ai_diffusion` updates don't require re-applying patches.
- The bridge can be installed and removed without touching the AI Diffusion
  installation.
- Failures on the bridge side never affect normal AI Diffusion UI use.

The trade-off: the bridge imports private-ish internals of `ai_diffusion`
(`model.root`, `model.regions._regions`, `model.regions._add`). If upstream
refactors those, the bridge breaks. The imports are localized to
`kritamcp/__init__.py` so the surface area to update is small.

### Threading

All `cmd_ai_*` handlers run on Krita's Qt main thread via the existing
`QTimer`-driven command queue. AI Diffusion's `Model` API expects to be called
on the main thread for document mutation, so this works out naturally without
extra locking.

### Job lifecycle

`model.generate()` returns synchronously after enqueuing the job. The actual
generation runs on AI Diffusion's asyncio loop and reports back via signals.
`krita_ai_list_jobs` polls `model.jobs` to surface state. There is no built-in
"wait until done" — the MCP client should poll or sleep + re-check, exactly as
the test suite does.

## Painting Approach (from upstream)

The plugin paints using **direct pixel manipulation** (not Krita's native brush
engine for strokes). Strokes use a custom soft-circle renderer with configurable
hardness. Alpha blending is done manually in BGRA pixel format. Shapes
(rectangle, ellipse, line) are rasterized directly. This approach is reliable
and doesn't depend on Krita's internal brush state.
